  name: Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Not Restricted
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that the use of Google-managed encryption keys for Cloud SQL database instances is disabled at the GCP organization level in order to enforce the use of Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) and have full control over SQL database encryption/decryption process. Note: This organization policy is not retroactive, therefore any existing database instances using Google-managed encryption are not impacted unless they are updated or refreshed.
  impact: |
    By default, Google-managed encryption is allowed for all Cloud SQL instances. Without enforcing CMK usage, you have less control over the encryption keys that protect your SQL databases.
  remediation: |
    Enable the "Restrict Default Google-Managed Encryption for Cloud SQL Instances" policy at the organization level using the 'gcloud alpha resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce' command with the sql.disableDefaultEncryptionCreation constraint.
