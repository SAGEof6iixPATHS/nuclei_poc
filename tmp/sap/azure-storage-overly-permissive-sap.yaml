  name: Azure Storage Overly Permissive Stored Access Policies
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Microsoft Azure Storage shared access signatures don't have full access to your storage account resources (i.e. blob objects, files, tables, and queues) via stored access policies. A stored access policy provides an additional level of control over service-level shared access signatures, enhancing security by managing constraints for one or more shared access signatures.
  impact: |
    Having overly permissive stored access policies can expose your storage resources to unnecessary risks, violating the principle of least privilege.
  remediation: |
    Review and restrict the permissions in your stored access policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
