info:
  name: Host ports should not be used
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: Checks Kubernetes Deployments to ensure they are not configured to use host ports, which can expose the host to potential security risks.
  impact: |
    Using host ports can compromise the isolation between the host and the containers, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to host resources. This can lead to security breaches.
  remediation: |
    Avoid using host ports in Kubernetes Deployments. Use services or other networking mechanisms to expose container applications.
