  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure the "Shutdown on Audit Failure" policy is disabled.
    The registry value should be set to "4,0" to prevent the system from shutting down if it cannot log security audit events.
    If set to "4,1", the system will shut down on audit failure, which could result in a denial-of-service condition.
  impact: |
    Enabling this policy (value set to "4,1") may cause the system to shut down unexpectedly if audit logs cannot be written, potentially disrupting services and risking data loss.
  remediation: |
    Disable the policy by setting the CrashOnAuditFail value to "4,0". This can be done by:
    - Using the Registry Editor: Navigate to HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and set CrashOnAuditFail to "4,0".
    - Through Local Security Policy: Set "Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits" to Disabled.
