  name: Server-Side Encryption with Service Managed Key - Disabled
  author: ritikchaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that Server-Side Encryption (SSE) is using customer-managed keys (CMKs) instead of service-managed keys to protect your OSS data at rest. SSE with customer-managed keys (also known as Bring Your Own Key - BYOK) enables you to have full control over the encryption and decryption process and meet strict compliance requirements.
