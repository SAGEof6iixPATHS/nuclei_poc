  name: Azure MFA Not Enabled for All Privileged Users
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for all user credentials that have write access to the cloud resources within your Microsoft Azure account. Multi-Factor Authentication is a simple, yet efficient method of verifying your Azure user identity by requiring an authentication code generated by a virtual or hardware device, also known as passcode, used in addition to your usual access credentials such as user name and password.
  impact: |
    Without MFA enabled for privileged users, there is an increased risk of unauthorized access which can lead to potential breaches and significant impact on cloud resources and data security.
  remediation: |
    Configure Multi-Factor Authentication for all privileged Azure user accounts to enhance security measures and prevent unauthorized access.
