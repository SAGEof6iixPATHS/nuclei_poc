  name: Unnecessary Service Removal Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that unnecessary services such as Alerter, Clipbook, Messenger, and Simple TCP/IP Services are not running. If enabled, these services can expose the system to security vulnerabilities.
  impact: |
    Operating these services can offer attackers potential entry points to exploit the system, as they are known to have vulnerabilities.
  remediation: |
    To stop and disable these services, run:
    > net stop [ServiceName]
    > sc config [ServiceName] start= disabled
