info:
  name: Check for Missing Network Policies in Kubernetes
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Checks if any network policies are defined across all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.
  impact: |
    Not having network policies in place can expose namespaces to potential security risks by allowing unrestricted network traffic.
  remediation: |
    Define and apply network policies to manage ingress and egress traffic within namespaces effectively. Use `kubectl apply -f <network-policy-file.yaml>` to enforce network boundaries.
