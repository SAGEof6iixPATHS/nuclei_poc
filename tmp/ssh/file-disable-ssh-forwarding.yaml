info:
  name: Disable SSH Forwarding
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: unknown
  description: |
    SSH forwarding can enhance security by encrypting traffic (X11, agent, or port forwarding), but it also poses risks if misused. Attackers with access to a compromised system can pivot to other machines, potentially escalating privileges or stealing credentials.
  remediation: |
    Set X11Forwarding no and AllowTcpForwarding no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disable SSH forwarding and restart the SSH service.
