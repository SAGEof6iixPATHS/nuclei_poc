  name: Check for Legacy Networks
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects are not using legacy networks. Legacy networks are no longer recommended for production environments as they do not support advanced networking features. It is strongly advised to use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks instead.
  impact: |
    Using legacy networks limits access to advanced networking features and can hinder scalability and security.
  remediation: |
    Migrate your GCP project from legacy networks to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks to utilize the latest networking capabilities.
