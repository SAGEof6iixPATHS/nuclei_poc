  name: VM Instance Preemptibility Not Disabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects are not using preemptible virtual machine instances for production and business-critical applications. A preemptible virtual machine (VM) is an instance that you can create and run at a much lower price than normal instances but it can be terminated sooner due to system demands.
  impact: |
    Preemptible VM instances can be terminated at any time to free up resources for standard VM instances, making them unsuitable for production workloads and potentially causing service disruptions.
  remediation: |
    Re-create your VM instances with preemptibility disabled. Note that you cannot disable preemptibility on an existing instance - you must create a new instance without the preemptible option.
