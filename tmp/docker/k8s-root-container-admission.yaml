  name: Minimize the admission of root containers
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: Checks if any Kubernetes Deployments admit containers that run as root, which can pose a significant security risk.
  impact: |
    Allowing containers to run as root can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to host resources, significantly compromising the security of the cluster.
  remediation: |
    Configure security contexts for all pods to run containers with a non-root user. Use Pod Security Policies or OPA/Gatekeeper to enforce these configurations.
