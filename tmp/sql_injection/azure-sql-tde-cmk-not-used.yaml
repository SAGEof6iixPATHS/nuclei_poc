  name: Azure SQL TDE Protector Not Using BYOK
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Microsoft Azure SQL server's Transparent Data Encryption protector (i.e. TDE master key) is encrypted with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key), also known as Customer-Managed Key (CMK), in order to protect your SQL databases with a key from your own Azure key vault. Using service-managed keys instead of BYOK can reduce control over encryption keys and security compliance.
  impact: |
    Not using BYOK for TDE can limit control over data encryption and potentially fail to meet compliance requirements that mandate encryption key management.
  remediation: |
    Configure the Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) feature of your Azure SQL server to use a Customer-Managed Key (CMK) from your own Azure Key Vault.
