    Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is a suite of security protocols offered by Microsoft to authenticate users' identity and protect the integrity and confidentiality of their activity. At its core, NTLM is a single sign on (SSO) tool that relies on a challenge-response protocol to confirm the user without requiring them to submit a password.
